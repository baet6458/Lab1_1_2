# CE-450/650 Lab 1 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 1 parts 2 and 4 submission
 
## 1.2 Your First Interactive UI
 
We built our first app,played with the user interface, and learned how to interact with the java file.
In lesson four we update the app icon
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
The biggest issue was some of the materials were slightly off/ outdated. Therefore it required
alot of searching to find certain items. The biggest lesson learned here is that there is alot
of potential to the user interface and the more you use it the easier it'll be.
